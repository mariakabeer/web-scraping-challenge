For this assignment, I heavily relied on past lectures and assignment examples.
When in doubt I would also look up questions online and ask ChatGBT.
For any notation errors that I did not understand, I also utilized ChatGBT to explain the errors.
In the second part of the assignment I used web resources to help me calculate terrestrial days into a martian year. I used Nasa.gov to inform my figure for already known data.
